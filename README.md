# LLM Chatbot (RAG-Powered)

---

## Project Description

LLM Chatbot (RAG-Powered) is an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances Large Language Models with factual, context-specific knowledge.

Instead of relying on general internet data, this chatbot retrieves verified information from a local knowledge base (built from ingested text, documents, or websites) before generating responses.

The system combines a FastAPI backend for LLM orchestration, a React frontend for user interaction, and tools like LangChain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI embeddings for retrieval and reasoning.

This project demonstrates the creation of secure, explainable, and domain-controlled AI assistants — essential for enterprise AI, internal documentation bots, and research assistants.

## Core Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — grounded, fact-based responses
- Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline — extract and embed text or web content
- Vector Database Integration — efficient semantic search (FAISS/Chroma)
- Citations in Responses — transparency for every generated answer
- React Frontend Chat Interface — real-time Q&A experience
- FastAPI REST Endpoints — clean, documented API for integration
- Logging, Config & CORS Middleware — production-ready setup
- Fully Dockerized — deploy anywhere easily
- Unit Tests — for ingestion, retrieval, and chat pipelines

## Tech Stack

### Backend:

 - Python 3.10+
 - FastAPI (async REST framework)
 - LangChain (retrieval & chaining)
 - ChromaDB / FAISS (vector search)
 - SentenceTransformers / OpenAI Embeddings
 - BeautifulSoup4 (web scraping)
 - Pydantic (data validation)
 - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
 - pytest (testing)
 - Docker

### Frontend:

 React 18+
 TailwindCSS / ShadCN UI
 Axios (API communication)
 Framer Motion (smooth UI animations)

### DevOps:

 Docker Compose
 .env Configuration
 GitHub Actions (optional CI/CD)
 Cloud-ready for AWS / GCP / Vercel

## How It Works

1. Data Ingestion:
   The backend scrapes or loads data from specified sources.
   It then creates vector embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB/FAISS.

2. Retrieval:
   When a user sends a question, similar chunks are retrieved via semantic search.

3. Generation:
   The retrieved context is passed to the LLM, ensuring answers are factually grounded.

4. Response:
   The chatbot returns a clear, well-cited response to the frontend chat UI.

## Installation

# 1 Start backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 2 Start frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest -v
```

---

## Docker Deployment

Run both frontend and backend via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will launch:

 FastAPI backend → `http://localhost:8000`
 React frontend → `http://localhost:5173`
